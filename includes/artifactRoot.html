    <h3>FHIR Artifacts</h3>
</div>

<p>This section of the Guide are the specific FHIR artifacts that have been defined to meet the business requirements. Like
the documentation, they are listed in the Table of contents (TOC) and will be displayed in this pane when selected.</p>



<div class="row">
    <div class="col-md-3">
        <p>There are 6 types of artifact </p>
        <ul class="list-unstyled clickable">
            <li ng-click="artDetail='logical'">Logical models</li>
            <li ng-click="artDetail='profile'">Profiles</li>
            <li ng-click="artDetail='extension'">Extension Definitions</li>

        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="col-md-9">
        <div ng-show="artDetail =='logical'">
            <div class="banner">Logical Models</div>
            <p>A logical model is intended to show the contents of a structured 'thing'. For example it might be used
            to show:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The contents of a message that is send between systems</li>
                <li>Data that should be captured and stored</li>
                <li>The structure of a particular document type (Like an ED Discharge Note)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It uses the same infrastructure as the usual FHIR resources (eg the same dataTypes, and uses a
            StructureDefinition resource to store it), but it is not constrained to the resource types defined in the
            FHIR specification. This does mean that 'instances' of sample data that are created according to the
            structure in a Logical Model cannot be saved in a standard FHIR server.</p>
            <p>So it's an analysis tool used to capture business requirements (at least the data componnet of those requirements)
            as a step before creating the real FHIR conformance artifacts. It is intended that anyone can create a Logical Model
            (and clinFHIR has a tool to to this), whereas it takes FHIR knowledge to define the FHIR artifacts.</p>

        <div ng-show="artDetail == 'profile'">
            <div class="banner">Profiles</div>
            <p>A 'Profile' takes a core FHIR resouce (like a Patient) and adapts it to meet the defined business
            requirements. The sorts of things that you can do in a Profile include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Adding an additional element that is not in the core. For example the patients ethnicity. (This is
                known as an extension, and there is a FHIR resource that describes it -
                    <span class = 'clickable' ng-click="artDetail='extension'">see the details</span> in this document)</li>
                <li>Removing an element that is not supported in this implementation (eg Patient.photo). In general it is
                better to leave these elements as optional, unless they are specifically not wanted.</li>
                <li>Changing number of times that an element can appear (its 'multiplicity') - within some limits. eg It is
                possible to make an element defined as multiple, but not the other way around.</li>
                <li>Fix the 'type' of some element. eg require that an identifier must be of a given system - such as the
                New Zealand National Health Index
                    (<a href="http://www.health.govt.nz/our-work/health-identity/national-health-index" target="_blank">NHI</a>).</li>
            </ul>

        </div>
        <div ng-show="artDetail == 'extension'">
            <div class="banner">Extension Definitions</div>
            <p>An Extension Definition is the FHIR artifact that describes the details of an additional element that
                can be added to a core Resource during <span class = 'clickable' ng-click="artDetail='profile'">Profiling</span>. The idea is that when profiled resources are exchanged,
            a recipient can use the definition to understand what the element is intended to represent.</p>
            <p>An extension can use any of the defined FHIR datatypes (including referencing other reources) and
            can be either a simple element with one value, or a complex element with child values.</p>
            <p>It is possible that an extension value can be of different datatypes (eg a string or a date), though
            a given instance will only have one of them.</p>
